/**
 * A control is a visible widget with a DOM element in a fixed position on the
 * screen. They can involve user input (buttons), or be informational only; the
 * position is determined using CSS. By default these are placed in the
 * container with CSS class name `ol-overlaycontainer-stopevent`, but can use
 * any outside DOM element.
 *
 * This is the base class for controls. You can use it for simple custom
 * controls by creating the element with listeners, creating an instance: ```js
 * var myControl = new ol.control.Control({element: myElement}); ``` and then
 * adding this to the map.
 *
 * The main advantage of having this as a control rather than a simple separate
 * DOM element is that preventing propagation is handled for you. Controls will
 * also be `ol.Object`s in a `ol.Collection`, so you can use their methods.
 *
 * You can also extend this base for your own control class. See
 * examples/custom-controls for an example of how to do this.
